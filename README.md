In recent memory, an outbreak of M bovis in cattle has been identified in specific counties in Michigan, USA. Through many years of sampling collected specimen from these areas, SNP sequences of extracted M bovis were collected alongside auxiliary metadata of the host organism that can help in the formation of incidence plots for multiple species.
Here, we treat the incidence plot as a time series and do various analytical procedures with incidence and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in order to characterize the outbreak of the M. Bovis disease in Michigan. The hope is to take these disparate datasets and be able to integrate them into a functional way that can help infer the dynamics that population species play in order to facilitate the maintenance of pathogenic diseases.
